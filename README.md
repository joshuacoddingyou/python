# Certification Authority in Python
The goal of pyCA is to keep as much configuration data in OpenSSL's configuration file (most times called openssl.cnf) as possible because it is much easier to keep one file up-to-date and consistent. pyCA also tries to reduce administrative tasks and end-user's frustration by generating specific input forms for a certain CA definition (certificate type) to avoid users generating invalid certificate requests which does not fulfill the policy of a certificate authority.
Although a lot of parameters already known in OpenSSL are used it was necessary to add some new sections and attributes for reaching this goal. These extensions have nothing to do with the OpenSSL-package itself and hopefully will not conflict with new parameters introduced in OpenSSL.
